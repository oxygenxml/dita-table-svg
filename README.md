# dita-table-svg
DITA Open Toolkit plugin which converts DITA tables having a certain structure to SVG graphs.

The plugin was tested and developed with DITA OT 3.2.1 but it should work also with DITA OT 2.x.

If you set the @outputclass="embed-svg-report" attribute on a DITA table the plugin will attempt to convert it to SVG.

The "samples" folder contains a sample DITA topic with a table which when converted to HTML and PDF-based outputs converts the table to an SVG graph.

Example:
